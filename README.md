# VortexLattice
Chebyshev polynomial method for the Bogoliubov-de Gennes equations in s-wave superconductor with a vortex lattice. See, Y. Nagai, Y. Ota and M. Machida, J. Phys. Soc. Jpn. **81**, 024710 (2012).

The codes are written by Julia 0.6.2.

Now I confirmed that the codes work in Julia 1.0.0.


Julia is a high-level, high-performance dynamic programming language for numerical computing.

I do not guarantee any results getting from these codes. If these codes are usefull for you, please cite the paper Y. Nagai, Y. Ota and M. Machida, J. Phys. Soc. Jpn. **81**, 024710 (2012).
